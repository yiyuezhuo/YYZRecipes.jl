# YYZRecipes

This package makes more `plot(something)` to "just work". In principle I should send some PRs to related packages. But some may not be consistent with their original "flavor" (`StatsPlots` in my mind.), and some are too lazy to accept any PRs. So I rather collect them in the package.

All dependencies except `RecipesBase` and `Requires` are loaded by [Requires.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Requires.jl) to decrease loading time.
